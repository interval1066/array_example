<p>Just an example of using std array someone wanted me to write.</p>

<p>A template class using a vector of arrays of type T is declared to a maximum of 256 elements, insert, delete, count methods added via a separate class, then a quick example using uint8_t types in main so it can be examined easily. You can change the type passed to the class but the output is odd, of course. Could add a display method to ouput to strings of hex numbers.</p>
